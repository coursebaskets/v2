Fun project for retreats which need question, gratitude, and botheration baskets! This is a modification of the "all/" repo (the first version of this website) using Google Apps Engine. 

If you'd like to add your own front end in a different language, please feel free to make a pull request with a new "index_[lang].html", i.e. "index_hindi.html". I'll then assign you a particular "id" number which you can attach to the basket link you send to participants. For example, if I assign you id=15, your link would look like this: http://coursebaskets.github.io/v2/index_hindi.html?cid=15. Then, when questions/gratitudes are posted, they'll be sent to the backend app which will populate entries on a unique spreadsheet corresponding to that id. You'll be granted access to that spreadsheet so you can see the questions/gratitudes that are sent.

Many, many SO, w3, and tutorial posts used in quickly building this. I took code from these Q&A/tutorials and modified/used it (did not copy code from any existing projects/pages, only tutorials, guides, Q&A, etc). Some I have specifically mentioned in the code itself, others that I still have in my history am including here to give credit to. The landing page code/CSS is also from tutorial, can't seem to find it. Included those I had in my history, likely missing some here - see credits.txt in the other "all/" repo.
