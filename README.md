Many, many SO, w3, and tutorial posts used in quickly building this. I took code from these Q&A/tutorials and modified/used it (did not copy code from any existing projects/pages, only tutorials, guides, Q&A, etc). Some I have specifically mentioned in the code itself, others that I still have in my history am including here to give credit to. The landing page code/CSS is also from tutorial, can't seem to find it. Included those I had in my history, likely missing some here - see credits.txt in the other "all/" repo.
